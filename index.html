            <p class = "aboutMe hideMe">
               My name is J.A. Faburrieta and am currently working on becoming a web developer.
               Experience with the subject is thin but it has been one of my favorite practices ever
               since college.  Along with progaming I enjoy sculpting and writing in my free time and 
               the hope is that I will be able to combine these passions in a programing format.

                        <h3>FIRST PROJECT</h3>
                        <p>This project was a collaborative work that was aimed at creating an app that would assist a user in planning
                            potential road trips by providing weather infomation along a route and a planner tool for keeping track of tasks 
                            that needed to be done before, during and after the trip.

                        <h3>DAY PLANNER</h3>
                        <p>This app was an assignment that would allow a user to save notes on planned activities though out the day.
                            It would correctly determine the time of day to color code which segments were either past, present, or future.
                            The app was also able to persist user entries through site reloads.

                    <p>This app was an assignment that would allow the user to perform a very basic location search by name in order 
                        to get and display the weather for said location. It would display the current conditions as well as a slightly simpler
                        5 day forcast. It would also persist search user search history and display it in a scrollable div.
