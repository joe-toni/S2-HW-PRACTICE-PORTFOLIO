# S2-HW-PRACTICE-PORTFOLIO
This repository was made for a practice portfolio assignment, it contains the main html site file along with a sourcecs folder that holds all the images used on the site and a css 
style sheet. The page was formated to closely immitate the sample site given in the assignment read me file. While the first link was made to redirect towards a previous assignment 
the others where simply given links to other sites of which I have no affiliation with. The information at the bottom of the page is placeholder as well. The site layout is responsive 
and displays the proportions requested in the assignment specifications with the first site being larger than the others when viewed at full screen. As the site sizes down 
the navigation links wrap below the page Title and the assignment links flex into a single column.
