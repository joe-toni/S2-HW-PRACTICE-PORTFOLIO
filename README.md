# S8-HW-UPDATED-PORTFOLIO
##### Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript
This repository was renamed and updated for submission of my updated portfolio assignment. The origial portfolio assignment was created using a given template which we were allowed to follow, this updated version attempts to move away from that initial template in order to better reflect our newer skills and expierence. The Updated Version requested that we replaced any placeholder objects with displays and links to our actually worked projects. Another requierment for this assignment was that we make it mobile friendly by having the contents display properly on smaller screens, this was done by first setting up the page and its basic functions at full screen then creating a second style sheet that would contain a media query which would activate when the window width reached a small enough threshold. The styling would then focus on using the cascading call nature of CSS to over Write exitings attributes. A javaScript file was also created to add in a very light touch of user interactivity, Mainly being able to display and hide the biography section and also being able to bring one of the projects into focus above the others in the same div.Below you will find a link to the updated live site as well as before and after images.
